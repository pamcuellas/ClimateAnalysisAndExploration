## Climate Analysis And Exploration
The goal of this project is to make a variety of weather analyses of the Honolulu, Hawaii area.
We use Python and SQLAlchemy to connect a SQLite database to retrieve climate information and load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
After, we use Flask API to create routes to return result queries in JSON format from our SQLite database. We also plot some graphs to illustrate the result of the analysis better.
